## The CSIL Tutors

The CSIL Tutors are a group of student-workers headed by Bill Sterner. They are your go-to resource for any CSIL related questions or concerns. During lab hours, at least one should *always* be present at the CSIL tutor desk. Their responsbilities include, but are not limited to:

- Opening and Closing the labs
- Cleaning the lab desks and machines
- Ensuring machine accessibility
- Renting out equipment 
- Stocking whiteboards
- Taking down or putting up the Hufcor Walls
- Resolving lab projector issues
- Gathering lab usage statistics
- Installing desired software onto the Macs
- Running Mac images with nightly revs
- Maintaining lab servers and backups

CSIL Tutors are **not** required to aid lab users with their programming assignments beyond helping them to have their needed software installed. That said, almost all of the tutors have some background in computer science. If they're familiar with the work and asked nicely enough, they are often willing to help.

## Lab Policies and Etiquette

Lab policies are those rules which one's failure to follow could have them removed from the labs. Lab Etiquette are those  guidelines which one's failure to follow will result in anything from security threats to decreased machine lifespan to disgruntled neighbors.

If there's ever an issue or question, don't ever hesitate to reach out to a Tutor.

#### Lab Policies

- Computers must be yielded to other users in this priority order:
  1. Users with a lab reservation
  2. Computer Science students
